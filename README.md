<b><u><h2>deep diving into IOC and DI</h2></u></b><br/>
<img src="https://travis-ci.org/alainlompo/xtreme-ioc.svg?branch=master" /><br/><br/>
This project is an indepth exploration of IOC and DI using various apis and frameworks to illustrate it. We mainly use the spring framework and Java/JEE, but from time to time some examples with other technologies and frameworks may pop.
